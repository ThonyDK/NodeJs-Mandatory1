            <span class="p3">Fetch:</span>
                The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request to the server and load the information on the webpages. 
                The request can be of any APIs that return the data of the format JSON or XML. This method returns a promise. 
                In the example below we have a fetch method that returns a list of users and it will be in json format on the browser.

                <span class="p3">CSS:</span>
                CSS stands for cascading style sheets. In short, CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text. 
                Whereas HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics.
                To use css there is a few things that needs to be done to get it to work. One way is to add this to the html document in the    
                head section, together with meta and then the href has to be the same name like the css file that was givin.

            <span class="p3">Import & export</span>
            If we need to use a function from another javascript file then if we are in the javascript file where we need to use 
            the function then we give et a export declaration in front of the function. Now the only thing we haft to do is to import 
            the function to the javascript file we want to use the function from the other javascript file. 
            Se the snippet below. It illustrate how its going to look like to get it to work properly.
