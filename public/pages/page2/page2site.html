            <br>
            In this part we talk about normal functions. Funtions is a block of code with 
            the main purpose to perform a specific task. The block of code has to get some input  
            that generate some output of the task. To clear this out functions and method are to different things.
            Below you will see how a normal function is illustratet.

            <br>
            In this part we talk about Anonymous funtion. This function has the same main goal as the normal function.  
            How Anonymous funtion is different from the normal function is that it do not have a function name. but we can 
            call the function if we put it in a variable like below.

            <span class="p2">Callback function:</span>
            <br>
            In this part we talk about callback functions. In basic callback functions 
            is a function that is placed in another function as a parameter. The function 
            can be called when the parameter is used.  
            The example below is a callback function and the function will be executet
            when a click on the button is made.

            <br>
            In this part we talk about sending data with GET. Normaly its best to send data with POST request. 
            It is still possible to send data to a server using URL parameters. notice that 
            there is a limit around 2000 characters in the browser.
