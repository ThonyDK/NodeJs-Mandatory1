            Are containers for storing data values. 
            In older times from 1995-2015 the declaration of a varible was named var but 
            this has in the earlyer days been changed. Today the generel rule is to use const 
            in all the code. There is some exeptions that if you think a value of a variable can change 
            then you haft to use let instead. If you use "Var" you will probably end up with bugs. 
            const and let work with block scope which means if variables or constants are declared inside a 
            block, they will not be available to the parent blocks.

            <span class="p2">Data types:</span>
            Data types is a very importent feature when it comes to write javascript code or code in general.  
            When we need to define something in the code we need to give it a data type to clarified it. 
            If we have a variable, then we need to put something in the variable
            and that could be a data types as a string, Number, Boolean, Array, object etc. 
            This data types is very important to maneuver with our code.

            <span class="p2">REST API convention:</span>
            Representational State Transfer aka. REST that sometimes also referred as a RESTFUl API. 
            REST-api is a well known method to exchange data over the network through HTTP method like
            GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DEL. This method is reffered as a CRUD operation.
            <br>
            <br> 
            GET: is a method to get data from a request from a client browser.
            <br>
            <br>
            POST: is a method to send data through a http request.
            <br>
            <br>
            PUT: is a method to change the data. through a http request.
            <br>
            <br>
            PATCH: is a method to change seperate data in objects through a http request. 
            <br>
            <br>
            DEL: is a method to delete data through a htto request.

            <span class="p2">Map,filter, reduce: </span>
            The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array.
            <br>
            <br>
            The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. 
            If this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. 
            If the condition returns false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.
            <br>
            <br>
            The reduce() method reduces an array of values down to just one value. 
            To get the output value, it runs a reducer function on each element of the array.

            <span class="p2">Hoisting:</span>
            Hosting simply means that all variables has to be declared in the top of the scope everytime. 
            If the declaration happens after the execution then the code will be buggy and not clean to read. 
            Clean code is very importent because the code need to be readable for other developers.
