                Is a an open source cross-platform runtime enviroment to execute javascript code
                outside of a browser.
                We use nodeJs to build backend services also called api(application Programming interface).
                NodeJs is a good tool because we can build highly scalable services. Many companies world wide uses NodeJs
                because its competible to javascript and javascript is a very used language. Through Nodejs you can use javascript code to build backend code. 
                This makes it possible for a developer to work as a full stack developer in a company.

                This file contains metadata and the dependencies we are going to use in the program. 
                To use it we haft to install it. First af all you haft "npm init". 
                This will guide you through the setup to create package.json.

                <span class="p2">Package.json:</span>   
                Now we have the package.json and then we need to add some dependencies that our program

                Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. 
                It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now we haft to install express by typing npm install express in the terminal.

                we also haft to make our app.js that contain all the endpoint to be executed, when a request or response is made from client.
                This file has sometimes different name as the alias server.js. 
                To use express we just installed we haft to import express from the library.

                As you can se we now have a functionel site that prints "Hello world" and we have set it to run the program on
                port 8080 that we use to develop the program locally.

                <span class="p2">Serving html</span>    
                To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static built-in middleware function in Express.

                Rotues are specified in our app.js. The route requires a method. In that method we give arguments
                one endpoint and a callback function with 2 arguments/parameters that we name request and response. 
                This endpoint below will execute the frontpage which means that when the client request for the endpoint, then the frontpage will show up.

                <span class="p2">Nodemon:</span>   
                Nodemon is a popular tool that is used for the development of applications based on node.js. 
                It simply restarts the node application whenever it observes a changes in the file. It is presentet 
                in our enviroment variables to run everytime that enviroment variable script runs.  
                Futher information will be discribed below. 
                <span class="p4">Snipped of nodemon install and run command:</span>
                <img src="../images/nodemon_install.PNG" width="350px" alt="">

            <div class="flex-container10"> 
                <span class="p2">Enviroment variables: </span>   
                When it comes to setup enviroment variables then we need to add a script into the package.json
                that contain our dependencies.
                We also need to add cross-env in our dependencies, of that reason that we need to use it in the script.
                The script can hold different ways to start the application 
                with or without i a feature. 
                If you look at the example below then you will find a way to make sure that the application will run on 
                a port. If we had to deploy the application then it needs to run on a port. It will then 
                try to find the port to run, but if it do not find a port then it will allways run on port 8080 which means that it 
                will run locally on the machine.  
                So if we didnt access the enviroment variable through the script in package.json then it would allways run on port 8080.
                as illustrated in the first snipped.  
                <span class="p4">First snippet:</span>
                <img src="../images/without_env.PNG" width="350px" alt="">
                Second snippet show how the script make sure that it search for the right port before it will go to port 8080.
                To access the script we use process.env as illustrated below. 
                <span class="p4">Second snippet</span>
                <img src="../images/with_env.PNG" width="350px" alt="">

            <div class="flex-container11"> 
                <span class="p2">SSR and CSR:</span>   
                To make the app run as ssr then we need to add a javascript file with the alias templateEngine. This peace of code will be the keyholder to render pages
                and in the same time also exclude redundancy of code. For example having a navbar rendering from the navbar directory instead of having navbar on multiple html sites.  
                inside the templateEngine there will be used a method called fs. Fs is a importet method that makes it possible to readFile like html pages. 
                The templateEngine that holds the renderpage function will make sure that the right html page will come to the client and with the right css styling to the page.  
                <br>
                Client side rendering also called csr is another way to make the application running. Client-side rendering means that a websites 
                JavaScript is rendered in your browser, rather than on the websites server. 
                So now, instead of getting all the content from the HTML doc, only the required HTML with the JS files will be rendered. 
                <span class="p4">So the question is why use ssr vs csr?: </span> 
                Server-side rendering is better for SEO than client-side rendering. 
                This is because server-side rendering can speed up page load times, 
                which not only improves the user experience, but can help your site rank to be better in Google search results.
